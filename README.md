# Block Clock

A clock in block form. Although, it's not a clock. At least yet. Maybe I should call it Block Not Clock. It has a simple HTTP interface that I use Home Assistant to POST messages to it (i.e. RSS feed data for news or dad jokes).

The hardware and most of the firmware code is based on Architeuthis-Flux/IGV1-16_Driver_Backpack. TODO
